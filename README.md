## What is QAOA?

"Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm"

* Protocol for approximately solving an optimization problem on a quantum computer
* Can be implemented on near-term devices!
* Variable parameter $$p$$ (depth) -- the optimal performance increases with $$p$$ and solves the problem as $$p \to \infty$$
* In order to use this algorithm optimally, you have to tune $$2p$$ parameters (this gets hard as $$p$$ grows!)
* Some tutorials [here](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_maxcut.html) and [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html)
